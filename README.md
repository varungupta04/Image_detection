# FashionGAN

FashionGAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate fashion images. It is trained on the FashionMNIST dataset provided by TensorFlow. This project aims to demonstrate the capability of GANs to generate realistic fashion images.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- ipywidgets (for interactive visualization)

### Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu matplotlib tensorflow-datasets ipywidgets
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varungupta04/Image_detection
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 
   ```

3. Run the GAN:

   ```bash
   Run the .ipynb file available
   ```

### Results

The trained model will generate fashion images. Sample outputs will be saved in the `output/` directory.
